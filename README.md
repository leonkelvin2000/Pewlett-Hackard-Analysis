# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

- We are helping the organization understand how many people will likely be retiring over the new few years. We are also being asked to identify how many employees could realistically be trained to take the place of many of those people who are retiring. The Pewlet-Hackard organization would like to understand just how many people are retiring per title. We have also been asked to identify how many people by title would be eligible for a mentorship program. 

## Results: 

- Pewlett-Hackard will be losing 72,458 people over the next few years based on looking at employee born from 1952 to 1955.

## Summary

- There will need to be 72,458 roles filled over the next few years as those who are eligible take their retirement with 1,549 current employees eligible for mentorships, that would mean that Pewlett-Hackard would have to go external to hire 70,909 people. 

- When we look at the breakdown or people close to retirement by title vs. the mentorship eligible employees - there will be a big gap that will have to be filled by external hires or headcount would have to be reduced (of course other challenges with that).

- There are many retirement-ready people who could train the next generation of Pewlett Hackardemployees, but new hires would have to happen quickly to ensure there is time for the close to retirement employees have the time to properly train current PH employees as well as new hires that must occur to fill the impending gaps. There are however not enough mentorship-eligible employees if PH limits this program to only those born in 1965, they may want to expand to include younger employees to ensure more knowledge transter can happen betore the huge wave of retirement.
